Quickstart Guide
================

The following assumes you have MoSDeF Cassandra installed. If not, please
refer to our :doc:`installation guide <install>`. More details of the core
MoSDeF Cassandra functionality can be found under the Guides section of
the documentation.

Let's start by setting up an NVT Monte Carlo simulation of OPLS-AA
methane. We will use the ``mbuild`` and ``foyer`` packages to create
the methane molecule, and ``mosdef_cassandra`` to run the Monte Carlo
simulation. We begin with the required imports:

.. code-block:: python

    import mbuild
    import foyer
    import mosdef_cassandra as mc

Next, we create an all-atom methane molecule from a `SMILES
<https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smiles.html>`_ string:

.. code-block:: python

    methane = mbuild.load("C", smiles=True)

The ``methane`` object is a single all-atom methane molecule. It is an
``mbuild.Compound``. ``methane`` contains particles
for each element (C, H, H, H) in the molecule and bonds that
describes the particle connectivity. However, there are no forcefield parameters
associated with ``methane``.

.. note::
  Loading a molecule from a SMILES string requires the openbabel package.
  Though openbabel is not a required dependency, we *strongly* recommend
  that users install openbabel (``conda install -c conda-forge openbabel``)
  to have this capability and follow many of our tutorials and examples.

To add forcefield parameters to our ``methane``, we load the OPLS-AA forcefield
from foyer. The OPLS-AA forcefield is distributed with foyer. Note that not
all atomtypes are currently defined.

.. code-block:: python

   oplsaa = foyer.forcefields.load_OPLSAA()

We then apply the forcefield using foyer:

.. code-block:: python

    methane_ff = oplsaa.apply(methane)

``methane_ff`` is a ``parmed.Structure`` object that contains forcefield
parameters.

Now that we have a molecule with forcefield parameters, the next step is
to define our simulation box. Since Cassandra can add molecules to a
simulation box at the start of the simulation we can begin with an
empty simulation box. We will define an ``mbuild.Box`` with the box
lengths specified in nanometers:

.. code-block:: python

    box = mbuild.Box([3.0, 3.0, 3.0])

.. warning::
    Even though the default units of Cassandra are Angstroms, the
    ``mbuild.Box`` object should be specified in nanometers. This is
    to maintain consistency with the units of mbuild and foyer.

Next, we create the ``System`` object. It has two required arguments and
two optional arguments, depending on your system. The ``box_list`` and
``species_list`` are always specified. The ``box_list`` is simply a list
of the simulation boxes in the system. In this case, since we are performing
an NVT simulation there is only our single ``box``. The ``species_list`` is a
list of the unique chemical species in our system. Here we only have methane.

The two system-dependent arguments are ``mols_in_boxes`` and ``mols_to_add``.
Here we have an empty initial box, so we don't need to specify
``mols_in_boxes``. Finally, ``mols_to_add`` specifies the
number of molecules that we wish to add to each box prior to beginning
the simulation in Cassandra. We will add 50 methane molecules for this example.

.. code-block:: python

    box_list = [box]
    species_list = [methane_ff]
    mols_to_add = [[50]]

.. note::
    ``mols_in_boxes`` and ``mols_to_add`` are always lists with one entry
    for each box. Each entry is a list with one entry for each species
    in the ``species_list``.

We now combine the four components created above into a single
``System`` object.

.. code-block:: python

    system = mc.System(box_list, species_list, mols_to_add=mols_to_add)

.. note::
    ``mols_in_boxes`` and ``mols_to_add`` are optional arguments when creating
    the ``System`` object. If not provided, it is assumed that the
    values are zero for all species in all boxes.

.. note::
    Each item in the ``species_list`` must be a ``parmed.Structure`` object with
    the associated forcefield parameters. For example, ``species_list =
    [methane]`` would not work because the ``mbuild.Compound`` object does not
    contain forcefield parameters.

Now we create a ``Moves`` object. This object contains all selections related to
the ``# Move_Probabilities`` section of the Cassandra input file. In addition
to the probability of performing different types of MC moves, the ``Moves``
object also contains the maximum move sizes (e.g., maximum translation distance),
whether each species is insertable, and more. To create the moves object, we
specify the ensemble in which we wish to perform the MC simulation and provide
the ``species_list``.

.. code-block:: python

    ensemble = 'nvt'
    moves = mc.Moves(ensemble, species_list)

Some attributes of the moves object can be edited after it is created. This
allows complete control over all the move-related selections in Cassandra. To
view the current selections in the moves object, use the ``moves.print()``
command.

The only remaining step is to run the simulation. The ``mc.run`` function requires
five arguments: the ``System`` object, the ``Moves`` object, a selection of
``"equilibration"`` or ``"production"`` (``run_type``), the simulation length
(``run_length``), and the desired temperature.

.. code-block:: python

    mc.run(
        system=system,
        moves=moves,
        run_type="equilibration",
        run_length=10000,
        temperature=300.0
    )

A large number of additional keyword arguments can be provided inline or as part
of a keyword dictionary. See ``mc.print_valid_kwargs()`` for a complete list of
the available keyword arguments.
